Sysbox-Powered Github Actions Runner
====================================

The github-action runner image generated by this repository is expected to be powered by the [Sysbox](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox) container runtime.

The runner binary to execute and the configuration process has been extracted and documented [here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/hosting-your-own-runners).

There are similar containerized github-actions runners (GHA) out there, such as the one this repo is originally [based on](https://github.com/myoung34/docker-github-actions-runner). However, our main purpose here is to offer differentiated value through the exclusive utilization of the Sysbox runtime.

## Why Sysbox?

These are some of the issues we have identified to justify the creation of this repository:

* Equivalent solutions rely on the execution of `privileged` containers, which are known to pose serious security challenges.
* Other solutions bind-mount the host's docker-engine socket into the GHA runner container, representing a security threat.
* The above limitations constrain the use of one GHA runner per host. That is, `privileged` containers offer weak isolation among containers/host, and a single docker-engine can't be shared across multiple docker-clis.

Sysbox addresses the above challenges by providing stronger isolation among GHA runner instances and between runners and the host. Sysbox also allows the execution of Docker binaries (and plugins) within a container without resorting to `privileged` containers. In consequence, Sysbox can be used to host multiple GHA runners within the same machine.
